# devShop

devShop is an e-commerce store project.  
The project is made in React using the Redux Toolkit.  
All styling is responsive and based on CSS modules.  
Some pages have dynamic pagination.

## Run on local machine

```bash
git clone "this project link"
(You can find the link in the github CODE box)

cd devShop

npm install
(or yarn install if you are using it)

npm start
(or yarn start)
```

## Project status

The project is at the stage of completion, after several improvements (compressed images, tests and redux optimization), the development will probably end.

## Authors

The whole project was done by me
